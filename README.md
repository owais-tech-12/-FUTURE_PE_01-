## 🔗 Prompt Chain Steps

### 1. 💡 Overall Video Planning Prompt
I want to create a 60‑second explainer video using AI. The topic is: [Topic]. The target audience is [Platform, e.g. YouTube Shorts / LinkedIn / TikTok], tone is [e.g. upbeat, professional], and main goal is [educate / sell / inspire]. Output a structured plan with:
• A punchy 5‑word hook
• 4 scene breakdowns (script + visual direction + voice tone)
• A 3‑line call‑to‑action (CTA)
• Suggestions for background music style and pacing

Based on this plan, write a detailed script for each scene:

Voiceover text (2–3 sentences per scene)

Visual instructions (e.g. “show animated stock clip of XYZ”)

Subtitle text (one-liner)

Suggested B-roll or imagery type (stock or AI‑generated)
